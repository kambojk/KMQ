# KMQ

KMQ is an application where you hear a korean pop song, and try to guess which artist, song, or other fun categories that have yet to be implemented.
##Long term TODO list:
* figure out which back end web technologies to use in order to make this game the most **EPIC**
* implement about the settings to make this game **fun** 
* create some sort of user interface that is responsive and intuitive

For now since these goals clearly are extremely vague, I am going to spend some time clarifying and going further in depth on the first and last bullet points.
